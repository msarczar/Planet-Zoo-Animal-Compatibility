# Animal Compatibility Checker

## Description
The Animal Compatibility Checker is a simple web application that allows users to select one or two animal species to check their compatibility based on data from the game Planet Zoo. Users can see detailed compatibility levels grouped by tier (0-4) or specific compatibility between two chosen animals.

## Features
- **Single Animal Selection**: Provides compatibility information for the selected animal with all other animals, grouped by their compatibility tier.
- **Dual Animal Selection**: Shows the compatibility level between two specifically selected animals.
- **Easy to Use Interface**: User-friendly dropdown menus for animal selection.
- **Instant Results**: Compatibility results are displayed immediately after selection.

## Credit
This app wouldn't be possible without the data collected and provided by Villanelle (Steam/Reddit).
